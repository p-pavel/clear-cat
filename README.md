# clear-cat
An attempt to generalise the notion of category in scala

The library is based on the following ideas:
* there're more categories than just "scala types (of kind \*) as objects and morphisms are functions between theese types
* a functor is not a type (like List) but an object. (there're many possible endo functors like List)
